### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a feral programmer learning new web technologies every day.

I enjoy highly creative coding projects in my free time and work in the industry as an IT Automation Developer.

## Recent Work

I have worked recently as a backend programmer developing database procedures, queries, and some shell scripting.

More recently, I have been automating business processes using several popular LCAPs and writing data transformations in php. 

Over the last 10 years or so, I have filled several roles in IT from training and technical writing to business analysis and programming.

## Current Projects

I have several interests pulling me at any given time. 

Some projects include:

- Node.js REPL Game
- My Web Portfolio

## Past Projects

I have also worked on some React web apps and the Microsoft Power Platform.
